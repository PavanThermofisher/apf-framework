            <h2>The Evolution of Software Development</h2>
            <p class="lead">The APF Framework represents a fundamental shift in how we understand and organize modern software development in an AI-augmented world.</p>
            
            <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto; text-align: left;">
                <h3 style="color: #667eea; margin-top: 2rem;">Why This Framework Matters</h3>
                <p>For decades, software development has been understood through the "People, Processes, Tools" framework. This trinity guided how we organize teams, structure workflows, and select technologies. But as AI capabilities expand and AI agents become genuine development partners, our frameworks must evolve.</p>
                
                <p>While excellent AI governance frameworks exist from organizations like NIST, Gartner, and industry leaders, most focus on high-level principles and policy guidelines. The APF Framework emerged from a practical need: how do software development teams actually implement AI governance day-to-day?</p>

                <p>Drawing from enterprise AI governance experience and publicly available industry best practices, APF provides a complementary approach that bridges the gap between governance principles and tactical implementation. APF isn't about replacing existing frameworks—it's about making AI governance practical and actionable for development teams through ready-to-use templates, agent classification systems, and implementation roadmaps.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #667eea; margin-top: 2rem;">Humans Elevated, Not Replaced</h3>
                <p>This framework represents human-AI collaboration, not human replacement. Rather than replacing people, we're augmenting human capabilities and freeing developers to focus on higher-value work:</p>
                
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>From Implementers to Architects:</strong> Define system architecture, make complex design decisions, solve novel problems</li>
                    <li><strong>From Coders to Conductors:</strong> Orchestrate multiple AI agents, review and validate AI-generated work</li>
                    <li><strong>From Workers to Innovators:</strong> Focus on breakthrough features, explore new technologies, drive competitive advantage</li>
                </ul>
